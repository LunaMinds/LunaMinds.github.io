<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you claim to 'grok' some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your identity.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; The Jargon File
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While I&#8217;m sure my first introduction to the word "grok" was while reading the original source (more on that in a moment), my first real connection to the word was in the sense defined by The Jargon File.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a teenager learning to drive, my very first time driving on the interstate, my knuckles where white, I was irritated at all the drivers that were flying past me at speeds clearly over the posted limit, but most importantly <em>everything required concious thought</em>.  I had to conciously keep my hands at "10 &amp; 2".  I had to conciously rotate my eyes from the road in front of me, to the passenger side mirror, to the rear view mirror, to driver side mirror, and back to the road in front of me.  When I needed to signal a lane change, I had to conciously think about which side of the steering column had the stick I need to move, and did I need to move it up or down to signal a move left or right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have no idea how many interstate miles I have driven since, and while I occasionally still get white knuckles, most of the time I get irritated at the slow drivers, but I also rarely am concious of those things that required conciousness as a new driver.  While my eyes are constantly shifting between the road ahead and my mirrors, I genuinely don&#8217;t know the last time doing so required concious thought.  I simply do it now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, I know 'grok' interstate driving.  I&#8217;m focused on the big picture of my trip and my environment, not the minute details of driving.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Likewise, if you&#8217;ve made it this far into this article, you likely 'grok' reading English.  You don&#8217;t conciously have to think about what a capital letter following a period and a space means; you simply 'know' that a new, but related, thought has been started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Grok" in Grok.Land was born out of The Jargon File meaning.  In particular, I want to help facilite a rapid transition between concious, white knuckled learners into individuals who grok what they want to grok.  I want to enable a way for people to lean enough to focus on the big picture of their trips instead of the minute details of driving.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Robert A. Heinlein<br>
<cite>Stranger in a Strange Land</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The irony is that my goal for Grok.Land includes some aspects of the original meaning of "grok". I absolutely don&#8217;t want individuals to lose their identity, but I do want users to become part of something more than just a collection of individuals, I want Grok.Land users to form a genuine online learning community that benefits them in a way that no other learning environment has ever been able to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may sound like a grand plan.  In fact, this may even sound like an unachievably grand plan.  I&#8217;d be lying if said it wasn&#8217;t a grand plan, but it is something I have envisioned and worked toward for over two decades.  What will be rolling out soon is the minimual viable product.  In and of itself, it certainly won&#8217;t be grand!  But it is the foundation for the grand plan.  This article is an introduction to that grand plan.</p>
